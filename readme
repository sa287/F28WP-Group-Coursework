This project is created by Subhan (sa287), Stephane (StephaneT257) and Joe (jwc3). It is an arena style 1vs1 game based on collecting food sprites, gaining points for obtaining the food and eventually being crowned the winner upon collecting a specified amount of food sprites.
This game in the most simple terms is based on a charecter sprite donoted either as the colour blue or red, being moved by the user, to collect the food sprite donoted by the colour beige. Collection occurs as the result of the accurate collision of the charecter and food sprites.

The front-end will be done by Stephane and Joe, the back-end Subhan. It will be done using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The objectives will be eventually split up into the different facets of the project, however, at the start/end we will be working as a collective to plan/design and eventually test it.
These objectives will also be based upon the coursework guidelines.
- Game details, github setups, programming practises and testing plan are to be done 
- Client-side mechanics and serverside management shall then be done 
- Testing, making sure data management is correct and working on a deployment plan
- Security and analyses for weaknesses in the project will conclude the project
